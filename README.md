# 🩺 Skin Disease Detection using Deep Learning | Full-Stack Deployment

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to **detect and classify skin diseases** from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal is to make AI-powered dermatological support accessible to everyone—especially those who might not have easy access to a specialist.

While building this, I discussed the idea with close family and friends. **At least five people** expressed genuine interest and eagerness to use a tool like this to assess their skin concerns. That feedback validated the project's usefulness and potential impact, motivating me to take this forward as both a learning journey and a social utility.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a robust image classification model that can detect **22 types of skin diseases**.
- Deploy the model in a **clean, professional, and mobile-responsive full-stack web application**.
- Enable **users to upload an image** and receive predictions in real time.
- Allow **students and learners** to follow the entire CNN model pipeline from scratch.
- Provide **visualizations of training accuracy and loss**, helping visitors understand how the model was trained.
- Create an **interactive, educational platform** where common users and ML enthusiasts can explore the model, tech stack, and backend logic.

## 🧠 What the Project Does

- Accepts an image of a skin condition.
- Uses a trained CNN (EfficientNet or custom architecture) to classify the image into one of 22 disease categories.
- Displays the **predicted class with confidence score**.
- Shows **graphical training history**: accuracy vs. loss over epochs.
- Educates users on the **CNN architecture used, dataset details, model training workflow, and performance metrics**.
- Fully responsive frontend and backend with modern styling, routing, and animations.
